# Clean Arhitecture Rust Demo
* Heavily influenced by [clean-architecture-with-rust](https://github.com/flosse/clean-architecture-with-rust) project. Most files are copies/modifications of that projet.

- [ ] Implenet more Interfaces (WebServer, WebSocket, Desktop App,
    Message Queues (ZMQ, RMQ, GCP PubSub, AWS whatever)).
